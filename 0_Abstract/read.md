# Abstract
Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen.The previous system used to activate the wiper manually and the process of pulling up the wiper is difficult to be handled.Thus, this system is proposed to solve these problems. The objectives of this project are to upgrade the older cars system by providing automatic wiping system.The automated rain wiper system is used to detect rainfall and activate automobile rain wiper automatically without driver interaction. The system is developed to mitigate driving distractions and allow drivers to focus on their primary task of driving. The distraction eliminated with the development of this product is the manual adjustment of windshield wipers when driving in precipitation. The few seconds that a driver takes their attention off the road to adjust a knob while driving in poor weather conditions could potentially lead to car accidents.The aim of this project is to help reduce accidents that happen as a result of the driver intending to clean the windscreen when rain is falling thereby taking the attention of the driver off the road when he or she is switching on and off the wiper. In rainy days we suffer from the act of sprinkling of water on the front glass of our wheeler. While driving, when drivers cannot see visibly on-road vehicles they try operating the wiper on glass manually, at times switching on and off intermittently and this distraction might cause vehicle accident.So this project helps us to overcome the above stated problem.
