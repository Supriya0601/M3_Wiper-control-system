# REQUIREMENTS

## INTRODUCTION
In recent  years researchers  are  trying to  develop  automobile industry more  and more for safety,  reliability,  flexibility  and  entertainment  by  modern  computing  and  electronics.The  traditional  wiper  system  requires  driver  constant  attention  in adjusting the wiper speed using manual switch. And sometimes dust particles floating in the air are covered in the windscreen during moving vehicle.The manual adjustment of the wiper and windscreen washing spray distracts driver's attention, which may be a direct cause of accident. This project is up to minimize the drivers work by setting up automatic control system for windshield mountings which are wiper.It has a rubber blade made of silicon, wiper arm attached to the silicon blade, extendable linkage, pivots. 

## OBJECTIVE
The main objective of wiper system is clean the windshield effectively to provide clear vision for the driver.The system contains a microcontroller that takes input signals from the sensor and controls the operation.Also, to activate the wiper system automatically without the drivers inuput contol.

## COMPONENTS REQUIRED
 STM32 Discovery Board
 Microcontroller
 Electric Motor
 Wiper arm
 Wiper Blade
 
## 4'W and 1'H

### WHAT
 A wiper generally consists of a metal arm; one end pivots, the other end has a long rubber blade attached to it.
 
 ### WHERE
 Window wipers, also known as wiper blades, are attached to moveable arms on the outside of the windshield. 
 
 ### WHEN
  windshield wiper or wiper blade is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water, and/or debris from a vehicle's front window.
  
  ### WHY
  The main purpose of the wiper system is to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times.
  
  ### HOW
  They can be operated by electric motors.
  
  # APPLICATION
  * It used in car so that it can remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water, and/or debris from a vehicle's front window.
  * It protect from cause of accident.
