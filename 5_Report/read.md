# INTRODUCTION
In recent  years researchers  are  trying to  develop  automobile industry more  and more for safety,  reliability,  flexibility  and  entertainment  by  modern  computing  and  electronics. Consumers are expecting their car to be voice controlled, auto driven and GPS assisted visual directions for driving. Almost all consumers first go for checking electronic gadgetry before selecting  a  car. Bluetooth  hands  free,  mp3 player,  video/  TV  players are  even  common phenomena for a car.The number of accidents caused by distraction can be slightly reduced by eliminating the need for drivers to adjust  wiper  speed.  The  traditional  wiper  system  requires  driver  constant  attention  in adjusting the wiper speed using manual switch. And sometimes dust particles floating in the air are covered in the windscreen during moving vehicle which could be another cause of accident. The manual adjustment of the wiper and windscreen washing spray distracts driver's attention, which may be a direct cause of accident. This project is up to minimize the drivers work by setting up automatic control system for windshield mountings which are wiper
