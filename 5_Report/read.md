# INTRODUCTION
In recent  years researchers  are  trying to  develop  automobile industry more  and more for safety,  reliability,  flexibility  and  entertainment  by  modern  computing  and  electronics. Consumers are expecting their car to be voice controlled, auto driven and GPS assisted visual directions for driving. Almost all consumers first go for checking electronic gadgetry before selecting  a  car. Bluetooth  hands  free,  mp3 player,  video/  TV  players are  even  common phenomena for a car.The number of accidents caused by distraction can be slightly reduced by eliminating the need for drivers to adjust  wiper  speed.  The  traditional  wiper  system  requires  driver  constant  attention  in adjusting the wiper speed using manual switch. And sometimes dust particles floating in the air are covered in the windscreen during moving vehicle which could be another cause of accident. The manual adjustment of the wiper and windscreen washing spray distracts driver's attention, which may be a direct cause of accident. This project is up to minimize the drivers work by setting up automatic control system for windshield mountings which are wiper

## COMPONENTS
 * STM32 Discovery Board
 * Microcontroller
 * Electric Motor
 * Wiper arm
 * Wiper Blade

## ADVANTAGES
* You can make your own
* Work with a basic principle
* Very easy to make
* Easy to handle

## DISADVANTAGES
* Alert will be start when rain is there, sometimes it disturbs human
* It has to be in few heights so that something could not enter 

##  SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
The  following  measures must  be taken  into consideration  when using  the automatic  rain sensor car wiper:
* When the wiper switch is in the AUTO position, the wiper will operate for 1 cycle if the initial engine start is made. This may cause the wiper blades to wear prematurely. Therefore, other than rainy days, set the switch to the OFF position. Especially during the winter time, check if the wiper blades are not frozen to the windshield.
* Operating  the  wiper with  the  blades  frozen can  damage  the  wiper motor.  If  you operate  the  wipers when  the windshield is  dry without  spraying washer fluid,  the windshield  can be  scratched and  the wiper  blades can  wear prematurely.  Use the wiper with the washer fluid when the windshield is dry.
*   When it does not rain, turn the wiper switch to the OFF position
*   Turn the wiper switch to the OFF position before any car wash to avoid unwanted operation of the wipers.     

## CONCLUSION
Its less power consumption, been free from wear and tear as well  as  it been  possible to operate  manually/automatically by  providing on/off switch  all make this design a very useful and advantageous working model.Thus the advantage of this project, which  is  the automatic rain wiper, is  cost effective, sustainable,  and user-friendly.
